The elevation graph is calculated from the 3" DEM data. 
The data is held in a grid with a cell size of approx. 90 m. 
The data has a &plusmn;5 m error. Full metadata about the data and how to acquire the data can be found 
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/gcat_aac46307-fce9-449d-e044-00144fdd4fa6">here</a>
<br/>
If the path of the graph intersects areas that we have prepared water table data there will be the ability to plot this data. 
The accuracy is not as high as the elevation data and has &plusmn;50 m error. Smoothing with this error can make the 
water table appear above the elevation of the surface on occasions. 
Data availability will be indicated by the button labelled "Show Water Table". 
<a href="javascript:;" ng-click="toggleWaterTableShowing()">Click to {{state.isWaterTableShowing?'hide':'view'}} the water table extent.</a>
